# CodeZavod Examples

> Sample projects built with CodeZavod AI platform

## What Can CodeZavod Build?

CodeZavod creates real production-ready projects using 4 AI agents (Router -> Architect -> Builder -> Mr Fixer):

### Web Projects (React, Vue.js, Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind)

**Business Landing Page** -- 10 minutes
- Responsive design with animations, contact form, SEO optimized

**E-commerce Store** -- 15 minutes
- Product catalog, shopping cart, Stripe payments, Supabase database

**Admin Dashboard** -- 15 minutes
- Real PostgreSQL database in preview, charts (Recharts), CRUD, authentication

### Mobile Apps (React Native + Expo)

**Only AI builder that creates mobile apps:**

**Fitness Tracker** -- 15 minutes
- Phone frame preview, QR code for Expo Go, deploy to App Store / Google Play

**Restaurant Delivery** -- 15 minutes
- Custom tab navigation, state-based routing, native components

### Telegram Bots (with built-in simulator)

**CRM Bot** -- 10 minutes
- Express backend, auto-responders, test in browser without deploying

### Canvas Games (React + Konva)

**Snake / Tetris** -- 5-10 minutes
- Canvas rendering, game loop, touch and keyboard controls

### AI Promo Videos

**Business Promo** -- 3 minutes
- Claude scenario -> Gemini images -> ElevenLabs voiceover -> Kling AI video -> FFmpeg assembly
- 10-60 sec, 9:16 vertical, 150+ variations

## How It Works

```
1. Describe your project
2. Router -> determines project type
3. Architect -> plans architecture, database, API
4. Builder -> writes code in WebContainer with live preview
5. Mr Fixer -> auto-fixes any errors
6. One-click deploy to Railway with custom domain
```

## Technology

- Runtime: WebContainer (Node.js in browser with HMR)
- AI: Anthropic Claude + OpenAI (4 agents)
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL (auto-provisioned, works in preview)
- Mobile: React Native + Expo
- Video: Claude + Gemini + ElevenLabs + Kling AI + FFmpeg
- Integrations: 11 pre-built (Telegram, Slack, Discord, Stripe, etc.)
- Deploy: Railway + custom domains + SSL
